# BindIt

A pre-Dagger experiment.

## Description
A little experiment done pre-dagger, initiated by Tyler Goodwin and Christian Gruber, based on some initial refactoring of Jesse Wilson's mini-guice.  This never went anywhere, but it formed some of the early discussion that led to ObjectGraph which became Dagger 1.x.
